## 📝 Project Title  
*How Visualization Type Influences Interpretation Accuracy and Speed Under Time Pressure*

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project investigates how different types of charts — including *bar, pie, radar, scatter, and bubble plots* — affect users’ ability to interpret data quickly and accurately under time pressure. Using data from a real-world *Shopping Mall Paid Search Campaign*, we conducted a timed experiment with 40 participants.

We implemented visualizations in *Python (Matplotlib)* and *R (ggplot2)*, and compared the performance of each chart type using accuracy and response time.

## 🧪 Methodology

- *Dataset:* Shopping Mall Paid Search Campaign (Kaggle)
- *Tools:* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), R (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- *Participants:* 40 students with prior exposure to data visualization
- *Platform:* Kahoot (timed quiz)
- *Tasks:* Ranking, comparison, ROI analysis
- *Charts Used:* Bar, Pie, Scatter, Bubble, Radar



## 🧠 Theoretical Framework

- *Kahneman's Dual-Process Theory (2011)*
- *Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)*
- *Graphical Perception Theory (Cleveland & McGill, 1984)*
- *Tool Familiarity Hypothesis*

---

## 🧪 Key Findings

- *Bar and Scatter Plots* outperformed other chart types in both speed and accuracy.
- *Radar and Pie Charts* caused significant delays and interpretation errors.
- *Programming Background Matters:* R users showed higher performance in some complex charts due to ggplot2 familiarity.
- *Simple Visuals Win* under time pressure (position & length encoding more effective than angle & area).
